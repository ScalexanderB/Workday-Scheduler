# Workday Scheduler

## What I did for this assignment:

* Created pseudo-code to plan out the functions required to execute the application
* Made small adjustments to the html and css files provided for my own liking
* Made sure the jQuery and bootstrap sources were functioning properly
* Wrote the code for needed for generating the scheduler using jQueries
* Added the functions needed to store my schedule locally so they would remain after reloading the application 
(some googling was required)
